# Zirai-Takip
This product aspires to be our farmer's pocket assistant in preventing the losses of our farmers and increasing their profits with warning systems against severe meteorological events and agricultural suggestions that will increase the productivity of their products. ZiraiTakip aims to ensure that our farmers grow their products efficiently by making irrigation, fertilization and harvesting suggestions according to the product and to prevent or reduce the damages that may occur with pest control- spraying, weather forecast, meteorological early warnings. We are working to perform meteorological forecasts with higher resolution with artificial intelligence applications. In this way, we will be able to make forecasts according to the farmer's field.
Services to be provided with the ZIRAITAKIP system:
- Selecting/marking the field on the map,
- Crop planting: The farmer will mark his field, where crops will be planted according to the soil condition and weather conditions,  
- Irrigation The amount of precipitation, weather conditions and the appropriate time and amount of irrigation according to the crop
- Fertilisation: Fertilisation time / type and amount according to the phenological stage of the crop  
- Pest control / Spraying: pest control and pesticide recommendation at the appropriate time according to weather conditions and phenological stage of the product
-Fertiliser recommendation system according to soil analysis results
-Harvest estimation by mathematical methods, not by rote, with Effective Temperature Sum calculation method,
- Field-based Meteorological Early warnings:
- Agricultural Frost Warning: Field-based agricultural frost warnings with high accuracy at least one day in advance and recommendations to prevent the damages of agricultural frost, which will occur according to weather conditions and phenological stage of the crop.
- Storm, precipitation, extreme heat, etc: Highly accurate field-based warnings and precautionary warnings
- Field based Weather Forecast: High accuracy field based hourly-5 day precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind etc. Weather forecast


========================
To build the ZiraiTakip system, we will need to leverage several technologies to address agricultural needs through AI, real-time weather forecasting, and agricultural recommendations. Below is a Python-based system outline with key components designed to meet your requirements. The system can be built as a mobile/web app with an AI backend to provide predictions, recommendations, and warnings.

Hereâ€™s how you can structure the system:
Key Features and Technologies

    Field Marking and Crop Planting:
        Map Integration: Integrate a map (using APIs like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) to allow farmers to mark their fields.
        Soil and Weather Data Integration: Use AI to analyze soil conditions and weather forecasts to determine suitable crops for planting in each field.

    Irrigation Recommendations:
        Use weather data (precipitation forecasts, temperature, etc.) and AI algorithms to recommend irrigation times and amounts.

    Fertilization Recommendations:
        Analyze soil conditions and crop stages to suggest the right fertilizers and their quantities based on the phenological stage of the crops.

    Pest Control / Spraying:
        AI models can track weather conditions and crop phenology to recommend the optimal time for pest control and spraying.

    Meteorological Forecasting:
        Use machine learning for generating high-resolution weather forecasts based on historical data, satellite imagery, and meteorological data.
        Forecast hourly precipitation, temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc., for a 5-day forecast tailored to the farmer's location.

    Field-Based Early Warning System:
        Frost warnings: Use temperature data and AI models to predict frost risks and give recommendations for preventing frost damage.
        Storm and Extreme Weather Warnings: Implement warnings for extreme weather (storms, extreme heat, etc.), including precautionary measures.
        Customized Alerts: Set alerts for farmers via SMS/Push Notifications or the mobile app based on weather changes.

# Run the system
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Features in the Code:

    Weather Forecasting: The system uses weather data (temperature, precipitation, etc.) from an external API (like OpenWeatherMap).
    Soil Condition Analysis: The system integrates soil data (such as pH and nutrient levels) for better irrigation and fertilization recommendations.
    AI Predictions: A simple Linear Regression model is used to suggest fertilizer amounts based on soil nutrients. This can be replaced with more advanced AI/ML models for better accuracy.
    Pest Control & Early Warnings: The system includes weather-based pest control recommendations and early warnings like frost or high wind conditions.

Key Considerations:

    Real-time Data: Integrating real-time data from weather stations, soil sensors, and satellite imagery can significantly improve the accuracy of the recommendations.
    AI/ML Models: For accurate predictions in irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, use more advanced machine learning models.
    Mobile Integration: The backend logic can be integrated with a mobile app for easy access to farmers.
    Customization: Farmers should be able to set preferences or receive alerts in real-time.

Conclusion:

The ZiraiTakip system will require a combination of weather forecasting, AI-driven recommendations, and real-time monitoring to help farmers improve productivity and reduce losses. By integrating machine learning and meteorological data, this system can provide actionable insights and support for various agricultural tasks.
